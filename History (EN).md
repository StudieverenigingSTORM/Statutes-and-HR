# History 

October 3, 1964 was the date that an association called "Association of Mathematics and Physics Students Vucleon” was founded at the VU. In our somewhat dusty archives we found the statutes and rules of this association, showing that Vucleon had a penchant for purple (the colour of the association) and was recorded in the rules that the association symbol should exhibit an atomic model. They also stipulate that the association accepted the Bible as God's word. This is the first noticeable difference with our current association, which is neutral both politically and religiously. Besides that Vucleon indicated its administrative functions with terms like praeses, ab-actis and quastor, where we now use president, secretary and treasurer. In 1972 physics and mathematics stop their idyllic coexistence; the sub-faculty of these two studies splits and there are suddenly two 'Vucleon' associations, both with the club magazine the Bulletin 1081. This was confusing of course, so the mathematicians wanted to distinguish themselves. In 1974 the first Strotklep comes out (still in A4 format), including explanations about the origin of the name: "But why the name THE STROTKLEP?, you ask. Well, the editors found it very difficult to think of a new name. Nevertheless, we had the bright idea to take another look at page 1081 (from the BULLETIN) of a well-known Dutch dictionary. Also, we summed the numbers that make up the number 1081. Then we searched for the tenth word on page 1081, and that word was, yes you guessed it, Strotklep. "


Incidentally, many staff members did not like this name. Freek van Schagen says in 1975 the following about our magazine:  "An indispensable organ of communication within the sub-faculty. However, I'm not so impressed by the name. I have not quite understood what the inventors thought when they suggested this name." The editors had their words ready: "As for the name, the staff does not seem to like the Strotklep. These people may call this magazine the Epiglottis, though pronouncing that is quite a bit more difficult..."


# Establishment


The Interim Association Vucleon mathematics consisted of two divisions, a political committee and a social committee. To join you only need to pay fl8,50 (plus a packet of rolling tobacco according to Jaap Bosschaert, the president of the time). On november 21st, 1975, the General Assembly decided then that the new name of the association would be "the Cloot Crans' is, although the board thought this was a terrible decision. On the front of the Strotklep, which comes after this decision, rests the following text: Published by: the (still to be established) Association for mathematics students at the Free University 'de Cloot CRANS ". Following this comes the announcement of the inaugural meeting of the "Crans" (a subtle name change), which will be held on March 16, 1976. The next Strotklep calls everyone to become a member of STORM. What happened here?


It is so beautifully expressed: "The consequences of the continuation of the name" the Cloot Crans' was considered by the Board. " By the time the creation of a private association for math is done, it appears that what was expected happened: At the very end also has the name the "Crans" did not make it. When the proposal to fix the “Crans” was held, the voting failed and a new name had to be chosen. Kees Smit suddenly appeared to be very productive in that area, and his proposal to name the association the STORM (Student Organization mathematicians) was adopted in the 2nd round unanimously. An anthology of the names proposed in the course of time: Vucleon math, SOM, Epsilon, Wrustratio, Wiskie, VWSVU, Minus, Plus Minus, The Cloot Crans, The Crans, the movement of March 16th, Wistura, The Storm.


The association starts off well. In May '76 the following message can be found on the cover of the Strotklep: “STORM did not organize the WEEKEND". The people therefore have noted their name on the list in S4.08 for nothing. Small note:.. Thanks to the painstaking work on the typewriter the name STORM sometimes incorrectly appear in the Strotklep. Sorm is still an obvious typo, but you do not want the association to go through life as Stupid (STOM).


In October '77 mention is made of the use of a computer! STORM is now using one of these and the Strotklep prints a manual with instructions for reading and writing information so the computer can also be used properly. A shocking discovery is done in 1978, because when STORM has no president present, it might be useful to have a vice-president present. Nowadays many members are recruited by discounts on books, but this did not start until 1979 when STORM decided to sell them. At that time she made no distinction between members and non-members in the price for books.


# The first unofficial Anniversary (1981)


On March 27, 1981 STORM celebrated its fifth anniversary; it is a beautiful planned day with between the bubbles and the party a memorable event: a Storm Assembly. It will be the first and the last STORM anniversary where a meeting is scheduled as an activity. Times change (thankfully) and the same applies to the courses on offer. The first volumes of the Strotklep proudly shout "for mathematicians', though STORM will not last long as an association exclusively for mathematics students. In 1981, the study computer science is a fact and STORM gets members who are always behind a computer screen: the computer science students.


In 1983 STORM moves to her new room, R2.62. This is a happy event, but that unfortunately followed by a drop in the number of members: the number of members falls below 75. In '84 -'85 STORM is clearly in a low point; at the Christmas party, the main drink of STORM, only 10 people are in attendance and that includes the members of the borrel committee. During the Christmas break a burglary attempt takes place in the fridge and drinks cabinet. As a measure the STORM room is temporarily closed. Only in the presence of a board member can it be open and it’s will only open again if there is another storage place for all the money and the drinks. We occasionally find the five keys on a board are too few, however then there were only two available, so this measure came did not do the fun any good.


That same year, it is so difficult to find people who want to sit in the book committee of STORM, that the compensation stands at FL100, -. It also becomes clear that too few people join STORM and to get more members it is decided that STORM will make a distinction between members and non-members in the price of the books. The board is afraid of negative reactions, but ultimately they only get surprised asking why it had not happened before.


To get STORM back on track the S.0.S. is founded (Student Consultation STORM) in which the executive board, the editors of the Strotklep and seven (!) assessors take a seat and everyone who has even a little bit of interest in STORM and wants to say something is also welcome.


# The second unofficial anniversary (1986)


Then we are already in 1986, an anniversary year! This time the anniversary will be celebrated much more extensive: On Saturday, March 15th beginning with a lecture, food, drinks and a STORM walk. Then there is Tuesday, March 18th, with cake, drinks, and a kind of reunion, from the belief that STORM was established on that date. That whole week a klaverjas tournament is played and the week ends with a festive party on Friday. People find out that the anniversary actually took place on the 16th, but the program remains the same, since Sunday is not a practical day to show up at the university ...


In the spring of 1987 a mistake was made that would change the Strotklep: the printer accidentally does not print in A4, and Strotklep appears in A5 format. A mistake that was very appreciated; the editors received many positive responses and decided to stick to this format. They introduced the Ab Epis in the autumn of the same year. For this time the amount of news from the board was quite inconsistent, but now the secretary gets an extra job; he will henceforth have to keep members informed of the goings on within the board, a task that not every secretary takes equally seriously. The result: articles about cats, strawberry sauce, civility and, well, nothing at all ...


# Official registration at the Chamber of Commerce


Not only the Strotklep changes, STORM as well: it is decided that STORM has to be an official club, complete with a visit to the notary and registration with the Chamber of Commerce. On February 8 1988 STORM is an official association. She has deliberately chosen not to keep political hue, it's more important to have an institution which provides services to students than to have an opinion (which is something that will always repel a few dissenters).


The first new service that STORM will provide is a mediation service between students and their parents: the parents' day, because parents do not always fully understand why their son / daughter spends many hours a day behind a screen (or at STORM) and not at all what they do there. A day of following lectures, watching computers and drinking coffee would foster understanding.


Because STORM has gone through a difficult time, but managed to push through because a few brave souls have worked hard to keep STORM alive, it is only natural to thank these people appropriately . Klaas Sickle (Member of the board from May 25, 1983 to January 1987) and Nanda Verbrugge (Member of the board from May 25, 1983 until March 7, 1988) will be the first to be elevated to the status of people-who-get-the-Strotklep-sent-to-their-home-for-the-rest-of-their-lives on March 7, 1988. Not long after, on September 27, 1988, Wessel Zweers also becomes an honorary member because he has been on the board from May 25, 1983 until September 27, 1988 and all that time has been keeping the Strotklep on the CPR, with great patience, writing and editorial work.


Meanwhile, not only the member and honorary-numbers grew: at breakneck speed, the number of studies doubled STORM: BWI (Business Mathematics and Informatics - current Business Analytics) is introduced in 1990 and a year later AI (Artificial Intelligence – today’s Lifestyle Informatics) is born. Especially this first study coincides with a remarkable event: the number of freshman girls makes many STORMers intensely happy.


On July 1, 1992 the STORM room is changed into the board room. The fun does not disappear, it is moved. STORM has gained a room R2.61!


# The first official anniversary (1993)


1993 is again a jubilee year. The first official Storm Anniversary. Although STORM was already 12 years old on her official birth, we pretend STORM is five, because that is a much nicer birthday to celebrate than 17. If you exist five years it is of course quite logical to celebrate for five weeks and that has to be done enthusiastically. They start very cool with  a weekend for (old) STORM Members from 6 to February 8, followed by a reception. Then there are five weeks fully planned with all kinds of games, including a time trial through the halls, eggdiving, and a high tea with a baking competition. The best part is the programming contest for computer scientists (who writes the most useless program?) and the challenge for mathematicians to come up with the most original expression of 0. The winner of the week would be announced at the closing ceremony and handed the prize of FL150 – and eternal fame.


A lustrum needs to be celebrated for as long as possible and the less pleasant things as short as possible. On April 26, 1994 the shortest GA in the history of STORM is held. This so-called "lightning ALV ' started at 15.11 and closed at 15.14u. 3 minutes, beat that! The reason for this was a shortage of board members, but a new applicant had already come forward.


Another honorary member: Pascal van Eck on April 7, 1995 included in the list, because he did a lot during his studies for STORM, including two years of being a member of the board and continuous care of the plants.


In October 1995 STORM is met with an uninvited guest: a wanderer. According to the doorman this tramp is already convicted of assault (although this is doubtful) and STORM suspects him of stealing cakes and money from the drinks cabinet. This means that people need to keep a keen eye on the closing of the StoKa. Unfortunately, not everyone in this world is as sweet as STORM as would have liked.


1997: STORM starts to drink more! There used to be a borrel once in the month, even earlier there were fewer drinks and before that STORM did not exist, but now the plan is to hold a borrel twice a month. Experiments have been conducted and the results were very positive. This is an endeavour that still holds.


Upon the graduation of Hildegard Montsma STORM becomes very sad at the loss of someone who was sort of a mother, so she should just stay connected with STORM until the end of years. On May 28, 1997 STORM receives her fifth honorary member.


Not only times change, places also change and STORM have to move again. Temporarily the fun can be found in P0.45 and hard work will take place in Q0.59. People are looking for a new room and because the members do appreciate the light of day (!), the basement is rejected. There is also something that is available on the first floor (Q1.02) but it needs to be rebuild first. STORM will, as of September 2001, be temporarily located in a container, placed at the entrance of 1081. After those six months we end up in our so well-known S0.10 and get T0.28 as our board room.


While STORM is in the shack Europe suddenly decides it likes to use the same currency, i.e. the euro is introduced. This means that membership of STORM was going to cost 4.54 and that is not really a useful amount. It was decided to reduce the price to 4.50.


The third official anniversary (2003)


In 2003 we celebrate the anniversary in May, with all sorts of games and as biggest event a symposium (Tomorrow's Technology) in the middle of the festival week, followed by a reunion drink. It is a great success and people immediately talk about a next reunion drink, a pity that it will be only five years later: all those old STORMers turn out to have quite cosy.


Besides old STORMers there is every now and then also a great teacher and if the teacher has done a lot for STORM and often joins us on the CHIP Weekend (the intro weekend), it is nice to bind such a teacher to the association using an official title: honorary member. On February 25, 2004 this honour befalls Riekus Cook.


Less fun is that there is a break in into STORM: a closet is forced open and 6812.03 has been stolen. Luckily this is not at the expense of the existence of STORM, but the price of membership it goes up to 5, -.


In 2005 the university decided it will close all the doors of our building, apart from 1085. Thanks to actions from, amongst others, STORM, the door at 1081 may remain open when the regime is introduced on January 1, 2006.


# The fourth official anniversary (2008)


In 2008, the 20-year anniversary was held. This was a week-long celebration with various activities. There was a games night, a sports / detective afternoon, a reunion dinner with drinks and to finish it all off a Venetian masked ball.


In 2010 the StoKa has been refurbished with a new lick of paint, new curtain rods and a lot of problems. Tip: never grow on the VU! Unfortunately again committed a theft. This time it took the whole safe. Fortunately there was only about 10% of the amount that the last time it was stolen in the safe. Fortunately, there is good news: STORM gets a new space at. The new space is used for all the servers of STORM. There are tools, which are used to bring supposedly dead PCs and other equipment back to life. The space is called the ChiKa, derived from Chip Chamber, the chamber of the Commission Hopeless IT Projects.


# 2010 - 2014


After reading such a rich history it is good to come back to the here and now. STORM is still growing, with the largest growing studies being Lifestyle Informatics and Business Analytics and Informatics. It is notable that the male / female ratio is undergoing strong development. With three busy rooms, a weekly activity or drinks, readings, the introduction period, company visits, the Active Members Day, around four parties and five Strotkleps a year and a study trip STORM is one of the most active associations of W&N building.


# 2014 - 2015


STORM’s studies continue to change. In the summer of 2014 it received its first completely English Bachelor: Computer Science. Because of this Computer Science grows quickly to approximately 150 freshmen per year. The influx of international students means STORM has to pay more attention to the internationals. In the summer of 2014 the international commission was revived to ensure that these students received more attention. In 2015, the second bachelor English bachelor was introduced: Business Analytics. The study was already growing fast and opening this study to international students has certainly not negatively affected this growth. Furthermore, we have now have more than 600 members!
